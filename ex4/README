=  Description:  =
==================

hangman.py - A simple hangman game where a user is given a word pattern and he\she has to guess the word behind it.
             The user has 7 wrong guess when after each wrong guess the image of a stick man is added with another limb.
             The player has unlimited number of hints at his disposal. In case he didn't guess the word an message
             appears telling him he lost and shows the original word. If he does guess the word a message appears saying
             he won. Also in cases where he guess a wrong character or a letter which he tried before an error message
             appears.
